<p>
Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kazuki6891">Kazuki</a>,<br/>
I am a self taught programmer who has a passion for development and stride for the best quality and efficient code provided to each client. 
I have 8 years total of professional experience (Earning Income) and 10 years total of experience in development (Learning and broadening my knowledge).
</p>
<p>
Moreover, I like to always learn new things and develop new projects whether it be small and easy or large and complex. I love learning new languages and frameworks and will always find some way to advance my knowledge to the next level.
</p>
<p>
I have developed personal projects in which I work with web apps, APIs, bots, and databases. I used concepts of functional programming, object-oriented programming, REST API, and image processing.
</p>
<p>
See the section about my Development skills to see my projects and languages that I used, or reach out to me if you have a interest in working together.

<p>
To work with image processing, bots, and automation I used Python. Here's one <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raulpy271/telegram_ecommerce">bot</a> that I made, and a <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raulpy271/Fractals-JuliaSet">script</a> where I use image processing to create a fractal.
</p>
<p>
To develop web apps and APIs I used JavaScript, ReactJs, and ExpressJS. Here's a <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kazuki6891/DraggableDialog">library</a> that I developed with this language.
</p>
<p>
Besides, I know and like many concepts of functional programming, where I learned from the Haskell language and javascript. See a <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raulpy271/ValidationMethods">package</a> where I used the beauty of the Haskell type system.
</p>
<p>
See my <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kazuki6891">github account</a> to known more about these projects.
